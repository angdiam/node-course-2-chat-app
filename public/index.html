    <!--This section was added after event acknowledgement and download of jquery library  -->
    <ol id="messages"></ol>
    
    <form id="message-form">
      <input type="text" name="message" placeholder="Your message goes here"/>
      <button>Send</button>
    </form>

    <p>By typing jQuery('p') you get hold of your p tags.
      Similarly you can type jQuery('#message-form') to get hold the tag with id
    message-form

    <p>Now go yo index.js to create an event listener for the form</p>


    <!--below the script allows us to write js on the front end and the src to accessible
    external files. Below we are loadign the js socket.io library to the browser so that now
    that we have access to it we can create a socket to communicaticate with the server-->

      //Now in the chrome browser developer tools in Network you can see the different events from the browser to the servers
      //back to server.js

      //now that you set up io.on('connection') in the server.js we can do somehting similar here when we detect that the
      //browser is connected to the server. There is no needfor the socket variable in the callback - we have it further up
      socket.on('connect', () => {
        console.log('Connected to server');
      });
      //if you now go to console on chrome then you will see the above message onc e the browser connects to the server

      socket.on('disconnect',() => {

    <!--The code above is moved to a separate file and also the arrow function will be replaced by normal functions so this can run
    on all browsers besides Chrome that for sure will run ES6 Create the folder js-->
